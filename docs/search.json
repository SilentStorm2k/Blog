    "text": "I love playing badminton. However, I’m not very good at it, and I really want to improve. I’ve been playing regularly with a friend, watching tons of YouTube tutorials on technique and strategy. But putting those lessons into practice during an actual game is difficult without real-time guidance or feedback.\nThat’s when I thought about building Kuri.\nEven when I played casually, I often wished there was a free and accessible tool that could track scores, act as a line judge for close calls, and provide post-game analysis and insights.\nI’m aware that similar solutions might already exist, but I see this as a learning opportunity to explore multiple areas at once:\n\nBuilding a mobile application\nWorking with computer vision\nLearning to document my progress and write about what I build\nHaving fun while learning something new\n\nSince this is a fairly ambitious project, I’ve broken it down into smaller, self-contained steps. Each component should be valuable on its own, but together they’ll form a complete, end-to-end system."
