# Problem Statement

I love playing badminton. However, Iâ€™m not very good at it, and I really want to improve. Iâ€™ve been playing regularly with a friend, watching tons of YouTube tutorials on technique and strategy. But putting those lessons into practice during an actual game is difficult without real-time guidance or feedback.

Thatâ€™s when I thought about building **Kuri**.

Even when I played casually, I often wished there was a **free and accessible tool** that could track scores, act as a line judge for close calls, and provide **post-game analysis** and insights.

Iâ€™m aware that similar solutions might already exist, but I see this as a learning opportunity to explore multiple areas at once:

- Building a **mobile application**
- Working with **computer vision**
- Learning to document my progress and write about what I build
- Having fun while learning something new

Since this is a fairly ambitious project, Iâ€™ve broken it down into smaller, self-contained steps. Each component should be valuable on its own, but together theyâ€™ll form a complete, end-to-end system.

# The Plan

## 1. Identification

- Detect the shuttlecock in video frames 
- Track player positions and movement 
- Detect and mark court boundaries 

## 2. Assessment

- Detect when and where the shuttle hits the ground
- Determine if the shuttle landed in or out of bounds
- Track shuttle trajectory (similar to Hawk-Eye)

## 3. Video analysis

- **Shot Isolation**: Identify the exact frames when a player makes contact with the shuttle
- **Point Isolation**: Segment full rallies â€” from serve to point completion

## 4. Feedback

- Provide **coaching assistance** using pose estimation models (e.g., PoseNet, MoveNet, or OpenPose)
- Offer **tactical insights** such as identifying open spaces or poor court positioning
- Highlight **performance trends**, e.g., if backhand clears consistently fall short of the baseline
- Generate **detailed analysis reports** that a coach could use for personalized training plans


# Final Thoughts

Iâ€™m fully aware that this app will likely never be profitable,  especially at the club or amateur level. However, thatâ€™s not the goal, Iâ€™m building **Kuri** purely out of curiosity and passion for learning.
